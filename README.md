## 🛠️ Technical Details

The Google Authenticator Exporter utilizes several technologies to provide a seamless experience:

- **Framework**: Built with React and TypeScript for reliable, type-safe code
- **OTP Implementation**: Uses the `otpauth` library for TOTP/HOTP generation
- **QR Scanning**: Implemented with the HTML5-QRCode library
- **Protobuf Parsing**: Decodes Google Authenticator's migration format using protobufjs

## 📋 How to Use

1. Visit the app in your browser
2. Allow camera access when prompted
3. Scan a Google Authenticator QR code:
   - Single account QR code
   - Migration QR code (multiple accounts)
   - Any standard otpauth:// QR code
4. View your authentication details
5. For TOTP accounts, watch the code refresh with the countdown timer
6. Copy the code, secret, or export to your preferred format

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

Your security is our priority:

- All code runs entirely in your browser
- No data is ever sent to any server
